      "desc:8": "The §3Crafting Station§r is a highly §9advanced Crafting Table§r with inventory slots for item and tools. You can input recipes by either dropping ghost items onto the GUI, or by using the §a+§r in §2JEI§r. Crafting the items will use the items and tools in the inventory. The 9 slots on the right are saved up recipes so you can re-use them without re-opening §2JEI§r.\n\nSimilar to the Tinker\u0027s Crafting Station, what makes the GregTech §3Crafting Station§r amazing is the fact that §6it can use adjacent inventories§r in addition to its own inventory.\n\n§bLore:§r The reason Nomifactory had Forestry in its modlist was almost entirely due to the Worktable, which serves a similar function to the Crafting Station. A couple more Forestry items were used - but otherwise. the whole mod\u0027s functionality was disabled! That isn\u0027t the case in this pack.",
