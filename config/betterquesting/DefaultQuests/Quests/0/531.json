Shall we change this?\n\nBy building a §3Coke Oven§r, we can make §aCoke from Coal§r or §aCharcoal from Wood§r, in addition to §dCreosote§r as a useful bonus output.\n\nCheck the §2JEI Multiblock Preview§r for the structure pattern.\n\nIf the Coke Oven happens to fully fill up on Creosote that you are not using, break and replace the Coke Oven block.

Think of IndustrialCraft 2\u0027s Nuclear Reactor, or Railcraft\u0027s Coke Oven; they were revolutionary at the time.",
