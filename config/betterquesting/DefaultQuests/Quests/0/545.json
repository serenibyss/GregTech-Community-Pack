GregTech CEu comes with its own suite of tools made from GregTech materials - there\u0027s more to GT tools than Flint.\n\nA benefit to GregTech tools is the fact they are slightly easier to make than Tinker\u0027s tools. However, they do not upgrade over time and cost exponentially increasing amounts of XP to repair.\n\nThe choice is yours!",
